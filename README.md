"The old-timey sweets people used to think were appetizing!", you think, of what look like heads in jars.  They seem somehow eager to escape, to fly, to brawl...

Gumbrawl is a multiplayer action game where disembodied flying heads compete to chew gumballs and blow bubbles.  Each team earns points when a gumball touches their blown bubbles, but they can't be too eager â€“ while blowing a gumball, the blower is vulnerable and it might get popped on their face.  When they fill up enough of the candy shop with gum, a winner is declared.

The game is an experiment using DOTS netcode with client-side prediction and rollback to synchronize action in a fast-paced environment.
